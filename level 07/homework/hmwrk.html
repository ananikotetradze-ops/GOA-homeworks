    <h1>Seals</h1>
    <p>Seals are marine mammals that are found in oceans and coastal areas around the world. They are known for their streamlined bodies, flippers, and ability to swim efficiently in water. Seals belong to the family Phocidae and are divided into two main groups: true seals and eared seals.</p>
    <h2>True Seals</h2>
    <p><b>True seals:</b>also known as earless seals, lack external ear flaps and have smaller front flippers that are not used for walking on land. They are more adapted to swimming and spend most of their time in the water. Some common species of true seals include the harbor seal, gray seal, and elephant seal.</p>

    <h2>Eared Seals</h2>
    <p><b>Eared seals:</b>, also known as fur seals and sea lions, have external ear flaps and larger front flippers that allow them to walk on land. They are more agile on land compared to true seals. Some common species of eared seals include the California sea lion, Steller sea lion, and northern fur seal.</p>
